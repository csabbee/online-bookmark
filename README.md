# Online bookmarking

Trying to fill the void of a certain page that is gone bad...

## How to start

    npm install
    npm start

[BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) will do the rest;)
But if you closed the tab by mistake, you can reach the app with this url: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
